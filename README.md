while working over developing flutter apps for android, you may get struck with licenses not accepted or no SDK, for this just downlaod the cmdline tools and setup that into your sdk path. And run the following codes in your terminal:
- sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
- sdkmanager --licenses
